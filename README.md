## Features

This plugin loads video metadata from [Opencast](https://opencast.org/) to be released as OER resource (Open Educational Resources).
It uses block_opencast to get the series attached to Moodle courses and the API from tool_opencast to load the video metadata.

When a video is set to OER it also stores changes in metadata back to the video (license). 
The access rules for the Opencast video are changed, so that it is not possible to easily delete a video.
Information is added to the `block_opencast` view that a video has been released and how to delete it.

### On OER release

The released videos remain in Opencast and the link is provided in the release metadata.
The video will be set to public.

## Configuration

The following setting is available (by default enabled):

- Add the users and their roles automatically to the OER element when loading the videos from opencast. Users will only be added when the element metadata has not been edited and stored. More users can be added manually and also the automatically added people can be removed.
Following roles will be added: Presenter, Contributor, Rightsholder.
