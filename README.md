## Features

This plugin loads video metadata from opencast to 
be released as OER resource (Open Educational Resources).
It uses block_opencast to get the series attached 
to Moodle courses and the API from tool_opencast to load the video metadata.

When a video is set to OER it also stores changes in metadata back to the video (license).

### On OER release

The released videos remain in Opencast and the link is provided in the release metadata.
The video will be set to public.

## Configuration

The following setting is available (by default enabled):

- Add the people and their roles automatically to the OER element when loading the videos from opencast. People will only be added when the element metadata has not been edited and stored. More people can be added manually and also the automatically added people can be removed.
Following roles will be added: Presenter, Contributor, Rightsholder.
